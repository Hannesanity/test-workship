# How to Fork This Repository

Thank you for your interest in forking this repository! Forking a repository allows you to create your own copy of the project on GitHub, which you can freely modify and experiment with without affecting the original project.

## How to Fork:

1. **Log in to GitHub:** If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to sign up for one at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/join).

2. **Navigate to the Repository:** Once you're logged in, navigate to the repository you want to fork. You can find repositories by searching on GitHub or by following a direct link.

3. **Fork the Repository:** In the top-right corner of the repository page, click the "Fork" button. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

4. **Wait for the Fork:** GitHub will now create a fork of the repository in your account. This process usually only takes a few moments.

5. **Clone Your Fork:** Once the fork is created, you'll want to clone it to your local machine so you can work on it. To do this, click the green "Code" button on your fork's repository page, copy the URL, and use it to clone the repository using Git on your local machine. Here's an example command to clone a repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
